I'd like to kick off my first blog post here on GitHub with some rambling thoughts and personal feelings at the very beginning.
To be honest, I'm not a very good beginner... My grades are poor and I always stray from my studies. Most of the time I don't bother to look up the things I don't understand. I'm just submitting my homework...

But!! I realized I didn't want to be like this all the time. When I tried to start learning deep learning related to my graduation project -- in my senior year of undergraduate school. As a beginner, I always want to try to master something. But I just seem to follow tutorials and copy beautiful code written by other people - without knowing where it came from - or where it goes.

Although my graduation project didn't use much deep learning code, my advisor always said to me, "You're just an undergraduate, I don't ask you to do anything more." But I still want to understand more, with my stupid brain. So here's where I start some of my messy study records!

Also: My English is very poor (in fact I haven't found what I'm good at), so I have trouble reading a lot of material. Thanks to the translation software, I can write this short article smoothly.
